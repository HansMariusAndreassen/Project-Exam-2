## Introduction

Havens is a project developed as part of the Front-End Development examination. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in web development using modern tools and frameworks and to take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidate’s general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

### Objectives

- To showcase skills in front-end development using React.
- To implement efficient build and development workflows with Vite.
- To design responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces with Tailwind CSS.

### Problem Statement

In today's digital landscape, creating visually appealing and performant web applications is crucial. This project addresses the challenge of building a scalable web application with a seamless user experience. Havens offers a solution by leveraging the latest technologies in web development.

### Technologies Used

- **Vite**: For fast and optimized build and development processes.
- **React**: As the JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling to create a responsive and modern design.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **API Key Authentication**: Secure access to third-party APIs using API keys.
- **Environment Configuration**: Manage sensitive information using Vite's dotenv secrets for environment-specific configurations.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
